    "A simple recommender was implemented and evaluated. A brief introduction to recommenders is in order before describing the code and the results for such implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of a recommender system is usually increasing sales and user satisfaction. By recommending the right items, recommender systems bring relevant items to the attention of users. Most recommenders are based on the so called __rating matrix__. A rating matrix $ R $ is just a _number of users_ x _number of items_ matrix such that $ R_{u,i} $ indicates user $ u $ preference for item $ i $. This matrix can be obtained in different ways depending on the available data (more on this later). Recommendation for a given user $u$ usually proceedes by first __scoring__ each available item (based on $u$'s preferences) and then recommending items with the largest scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two well accepted categories of recommender algorithms can be mention:\n",
    "1. content-based\n",
    "2. collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "__Content-based__ recommenders are based on item features, such as color, size, price, free text description, etc. The main assumption of this kind of recommenders is that such features can determine how relevant an item is for a given user. A user profile is obtained by training a model based on item features and user past ratings. This is training step is just a traditional machine learning regression/classification training step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ratings of the other users are not taken into account in content-based recommenders. This reduces the novelty of the recommended items. Recommended items have often similar features to items previuosly liked by the user (this makes sense, because the trained model is based solely on a fixed set of features). Nevertheless, content-based recommenders do have several advantages, as discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Collaborative filtering__ recommenders, on the other hand, suggest items to a given user based on the other users’ ratings. The central idea of this algorithms is that different items can be strongly correlated in terms of the ratings the users give them. This is crucially different than content-based approaches: two items A and B with completely different feature values (color, size, price, etc) can be considered similar because many users gave both items similar ratings; as a consequence, a certain user who liked A, can get B recommended. Collaborative systems have also important limitations, as commented later.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both kinds of recommenders leverage user's past ratings to infer relevant recommendations, only the latter takes fully advantage of the whole rating matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender implemented for this project is a collaborative filtering method, knwon as __PureSVD__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive description of the different kinds of recommenders can be found in [this book by Charu Aggarwal](http://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319296579)"

   "source": [
    "PureSVD is a kind of __latent factor__ model. The main idea of this kind of models is that the rating matrix _overspecifies_ users tastes and items features. For example, knowing that a user liked three Indian food restaurants suggests that the user is into Indian food. However, the specific Indian restaurants that the user liked might not be that relevant. Based on this observation, these models try to describe users and items in terms of _latent factors_ that describe user preferences and item characteristics in a compact way. User descriptions, orginally vectors of size _number of items_, are thus reduced to much smaller vectors of key hidden features. Similarly, item descriptions, originally vectors of size _number of users_, are reduced to vectors of the same key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, these models approximate the rating matrix $R$ using two lower rank matrices, one ($U$, in $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times f}$) corresponding to __user factors__ and the other one ($Q$, in $\\mathbb{R}^{m \\times f}$) to __item factors__. as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{R} = U \\Sigma Q^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Sigma$ is diagonal matrix in $\\mathbb{R}^{f \\times f}$ containing the first $f$ singular values of $R$'s SVD decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$ rows correspond to item factors. Each item $i$ is represented as an $f$-dimensional vector $q_i$ ($Q$'s $i^{th}$ row). \n",
    "\n",
    "With a little bit of algebra, it can be shown that scoring for user $u$ and item $i$ (that is, $u$'s estimated rating for $i$) can be computed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{r_{u,i}} = r_u Q q_i^T\n",
    "$$\n",

    "To estimate the performance of the implemented recommender, the evaluation procedure of [Cremonesi et al., 2010](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paolo_Cremonesi/publication/221141030_Performance_of_recommender_algorithms_on_top-N_recommendation_tasks/links/55ef4ac808ae0af8ee1b1bd0.pdf) is followed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, users are randomly splitted into 10 folds and, in turn, performance is computed on one fold while the remaining 9 folds are used to train the recommender. Reported performance is the average performance among the 10 folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance in a single fold is computed in the following way:\n",
    "- For each user $u$ in the test fold, a business $i$ rated by $u$ is selected. \n",
    "- $i$ is removed from $u$'s ratings, and a score is estimated for $i$ using this modified version of the user's ratings.\n",
    "- Scores are also estimated for $k$ other randomly selected businesses unrated by $u$. An assumption is made here: those unrated businesses are not of interest to $u$.\n",
    "- A ranked list is formed by ordering the $k$ + 1 scores (that is, the scores corresponding to the $k$ randomly selected businesses plus $i$)\n",
    "- A top-$N$ recommendation list is formed by picking the top $N$ ranked businesses from the ranked list. If $i$ is within the $N$ recommended businesses, there's a _hit_. Otherwise, there's a _miss_. Note that chances of hit increase with $N$.\n",
    "- The procedure above is repeated for every rated business of every user in the test fold. Performance for a given fold is computed by the $recall$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "recall = \\frac{\\#hits}{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the number of tests ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the assumption that the $k$ unrated businesses are not of interest to $u$ tends to underestimate the actual recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure described above is an example of offline evaluation. While useful to tune models, these kind of procedures are not enough to really assess the efectiveness of the recommender. In a realistic setting, at some point online evaluations through A / B testing should be put in place. "

    "So PureSVD gives a reasonable improvement in terms of recall compared with naive random recommendation. Random recommendation is of course a very basic baseline to compare against. With more time, it would be interesting to compare against a recommender that scores businesses according to their popularity (i.e., number of reviews). In that scenario, it would be particularly interesting to test only on the businesses in the long tail(that is, businesses with a low number of reviews). Popularity-based recommenders will probably miss those businesses, while recommenders based on collaborative filtering should be able to take them into account. \n",

    "As a final comment, note that I have not tune at all the main hyperparameter of the PureSVD recommender: the number of factors used to describe users and businesses (n_factors parameter). I simply picked a value that sounded roughly reasonable. With more time, a grid search should be performed on different values, and the final performance for the selected value estimated on a held out dataset."
